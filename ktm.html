              Kottayam has a vast network of rivers and canals, which empty into the great expanse of 
              water called the Vembanad Lake, a fast developing backwater tourism destination.
              n the festive months of August and September, 
              the rivers in and near Kottayam are turned into festival centres.
              The serene lakes come alive during Onam with a spectacular water regatta – the snake boat races.<br>
               It is amazing to watch oarsmen, at least a hundred in one boat, 
               slice their way through the waters to the fast rhythm of their own full throated singing. 
               In the Kumarakom boat race conducted at Kavanar and Kottathodu rivers, about 50 types of boats viz veppu,
                ody, churulan and few snake boats participate.
