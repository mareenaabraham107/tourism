      <h4>THRISSUR</h4>
    <h6>The term Thrissur is the abbreviated anglicized form of the Malayalam word ‘THRISSIVAPERUR’ which means the town of the “SACRED SIVA”. The town is built on an elevated ground, at the apex of which is the famous “VADAKKUMNATHAN” Temple. A place of great antiquity, Thrissur was also known as “VRISHABHADRIPURAM” and “TEN KAILASAM” in ancient days. The District can claim to have played a significant part in fostering the trade relations between Kerala and the outside world in the ancient and medieval period. It can also claim to have played an important part in fostering cultural relations and in laying the foundation of a cosmopolitan and compose culture in this part of the country.<br></h6>

              On the outskirts of the city at a distance of some 60 km, the Athirappilly waterfalls mark one of the best places to visit in Thrissur. Standing 80 ft tall and about 330 ft wide, these falls are the largest in the state of Kerala.

The majesty of this place can be understood by the fact that the falls are located on the Chalakudy River, that originates from the highest mountain in India outside of the Himalayas. A perfect place for a group outing, these falls are sometimes called the Niagra of India

              In the town of Guruvayur near Thrissur, the Guruvayur Sri Krishna Temple stands as a true testimony of not only the devotion of the people of the state but also of the fine arts and crafts that Kerala is well known for.

Dedicated to the Hindu God, Guruvayurappan, the temple is one of the most sacred locations for the Hindus residing in Kerala. Inside the temple, you can find a number of artefacts that showcase the beauty of the handiwork of Kerala.

The best part of visiting the temple is that when it is lit during celebrations, the glow of the red and brick structure is a sight worth beholding.
