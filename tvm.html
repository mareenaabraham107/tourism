      <h4>THIRUVANANTHAPURAM</h4>
    <h6>Thiruananthapuram, the jewel in the emerald necklace that Kerala is for the Indian sub-continent, 
        must surely have Parasuramanbeen a “must see” destination for ages, 
        long before National Geographic Traveller classified it as one. 
        Surely long before Sage Parasurama , according to local legend, 
        threw his divine battle axe from Kanyakumari to Gokarnam to west Kerala, 
        God’s own land, from the Varuna the sea god; 
        before the times of Mahabali the democratic and 
        just ruler of this wonderful land who was sent down to the netherworld through deceit<br></h6>

              The origin of the Temple of Sree Padmanabhaswamy is lost in antiquity.

                from any reliable historical documents or other sources as to when and by whom the original idol of 
                Sree Padmanabhaswamy was consecrated. The Temple has references in Epics and Puranas. The name of the city of Thiruvananthapuram in Malayalam translates to “The City of Lord Ananta”,referring to the deity of Padmanabhaswamy Temple.
